{% block artifact_description %} The registry is a hierarchical database that contains data that is critical for the operation of Windows and the applications and services that run on Windows. The data is structured in a tree format. Each node in the tree is called a key. Each key can contain both subkeys and data entries called values. {% endblock %}

<p>This utility, which has the most comprehensive knowledge of
auto-starting locations of any startup monitor, shows you what programs
are configured to run during system bootup or login, and when you start
various built-in Windows applications like Internet Explorer, Explorer
and media players. These programs and drivers include ones in your
startup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other Registry keys.
<em>Autoruns</em>&nbsp;reports Explorer shell extensions, toolbars, browser helper
objects, Winlogon notifications, auto-start services, and much
more.&nbsp;<em>Autoruns</em> goes way beyond other autostart utilities.</p>
<p><em>Autoruns</em>'&nbsp;<strong>Hide Signed Microsoft Entries</strong>&nbsp;option helps you to zoom
in on third-party auto-starting images that have been added to your
system and it has support for looking at the auto-starting images
configured for other accounts configured on a system. Also included in
the download package is a command-line equivalent that can output in CSV
format, Autorunsc.</p>
<p>You'll probably be surprised at how many executables are launched
automatically!</p>

<h2 id="usage" class="heading-anchor"><a class="anchor-link docon docon-link" href="#usage" aria-labelledby="usage"></a>Usage</h2>
<p>Simply run&nbsp;<em>Autoruns</em>&nbsp;and it shows you the currently configured
auto-start applications as well as the full list of Registry and file
system locations available for auto-start configuration. Autostart
locations displayed by Autoruns include logon entries, Explorer add-ons,
Internet Explorer add-ons including Browser Helper Objects (BHOs),
Appinit DLLs, image hijacks, boot execute images, Winlogon notification
DLLs, Windows Services and Winsock Layered Service Providers, media
codecs, and more. Switch tabs to view autostarts from different
categories.</p>
<p>To view the properties of an executable configured to run automatically,
select it and use the&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>&nbsp;menu item or toolbar button. If
<a href="process-explorer" data-linktype="relative-path">Process Explorer</a>&nbsp;is
running and there is an active process executing the selected executable
then the&nbsp;<strong>Process Explorer</strong>&nbsp;menu item in the&nbsp;<strong>Entry</strong>&nbsp;menu will open
the process properties dialog box for the process executing the selected
image.</p>
<p>Navigate to the Registry or file system location displayed or the
configuration of an auto-start item by selecting the item and using
the&nbsp;<strong>Jump</strong>&nbsp;<strong>to Entry</strong> menu item or toolbar button, and navigate to
the location of an autostart image.</p>
<p>To disable an auto-start entry uncheck its check box. To delete an
auto-start configuration entry use the&nbsp;<strong>Delete</strong>&nbsp;menu item or toolbar
button.</p>
<p>The Options menu includes several display filtering options, such as
only showing non-Windows entries, as well as access to a scan options
dialog from where you can enable signature verification and Virus Total
hash and file submission.</p>
<p>Select entries in the&nbsp;<strong>User</strong>&nbsp;menu to view auto-starting images for
different user accounts.</p>
<p>More information on display options and additional information is
available in the on-line help.</p>
