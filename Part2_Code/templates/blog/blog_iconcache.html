<p>Now that your wallet is set up, you’ll need some ETH.</p>
<p>Ether is the native currency of the Ethereum network and it’s commonly abbreviated to ETH, which is its most common
    signifier. You need ETH to pay for some of your interactions with the blockchain, and to pay for the items you buy.
</p>
<p>Here are two ways to easily fund your account: </p>
<h4>1) Buy Directly within MetaMask</h4>
<p>Depending on your region, you may be able to buy ETH directly with a credit or debit card via a third party provider.
    Please note, buying crypto with a credit card may incur additional fees, depending on which third-party provider you
    use. You may also not receive the entire crypto amount immediately.</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Open the MetaMask wallet extension or the mobile app.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Press <b>Buy ETH</b>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Select a third-party service such as Wyre, Transak or MoonPay, which will facilitate the transfer of funds
            from your chosen funding source.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Follow the steps provided by the third-party service. You may need to submit personal information like an ID
            card or proof of residence to meet KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Once you’re finished purchasing, the funds should appear in your wallet.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>2) Funding From a Crypto Exchange</h4>
<p>It’s also easy to fund your wallet by depositing from a reputable crypto exchange, like <a href="#">FTX</a>, <a
        href="#">Coinbase</a> or <a href="#">Binance</a>, which offers a way to buy crypto with your bank account.</p>
<p><b>Handy tip:</b> You can use the FTX app to buy ETH and withdraw it to your MetaMask with no withdrawal fees.</p>
<p>It may take some time for the ETH to appear in your wallet. After processing your withdrawal, your crypto exchange
    should provide a number called a Transaction Hash or Transaction ID. This is a unique number for each transaction on
    the blockchain. You can use this unique number to check the progress of your withdrawal on third-party tools like
    Etherscan. For more information on how to use Etherscan to view transaction information, <a href="#">click here</a>.
